/*

Commandline yearly costs vs invoicing tracker.

Stores information in some sort of reasonable format, and allows you to look
 at the costs of the year, and the invoices that have been paid.

Can keep track of hourly rates, so invoices can be entered either as a sum, or as hours to invoice.
Costs can be entered as one-offs, or as monthly costs.


Example usage:
moneybags add-rate 765 hourly
moneybags add-rate 900 on-call

moneybags add-invoice 2025-01-31 1000
moneybags add-invoice 2025-01-31 50 hourly
moneybags add-invoice 2025-01-31 10 on-call

moneybags show-invoices
-> YTD: 48250
-> 2025-01-31 1000
-> 2025-01-31 38250 (50 * 765)
-> 2025-01-31 9000 (10 * 900)

moneybags add-cost 2025-01 10000 insurance
